append-only successor to GQG Core Card v0.10; v0.5-v0.10 remain preserved predecessors
Continuity
separate event violation from derived demotion, define the sampling frame, prevent geometry/proof-status leakage, and require an independent confirmatory pass
Purpose
retain the complete constraint-status state space while adding typed polarity, correction latency, layer-specific returns, and precision repairs


Versioning rule
GQG Core Cards v0.5-v0.10 remain preserved predecessors. v0.11 retains the typed temporal record, but deprecates bare empirical O and event-level binary B for new records. It adds a word-labeled empirical state, an explicit eligibility predicate, window-level binding estimates, a derived demotion rule, and an evidence-status firewall. No v0.11 classification is back-ported without an explicit supersession edge.


Claim boundary
GQG v0.11 separates theorem geometry, dyadic admissibility, and empirical instrumentation; defines eligibility before denominator formation; and distinguishes standing, event response, window binding, and derived demotion. It does not infer a hidden actor, motive, implementation, occupant, normative polarity, statistical independence, or universal threshold. Unknown, partial, excluded, and censored states remain explicit.


1. Governing upgrade
GQG v0.5 made the immutable-witness requirement explicit: source, view, decision, action, and outcome are separate records. v0.6 keeps that rule intact and answers a different question: what remains empirically testable when the privileged internal witness is unavailable?
The answer is not a witness hierarchy. A witness is evaluated against the claim it is being asked to support.
Witness fidelity = faithfulness of witness W to the source distinctions relevant to claim C
Fidelity(W, C) is claim-relative; it is not a universal rank of witnesses


Core rule
Claim precision must not exceed witness fidelity. A witness may have high fidelity for one proposition and low fidelity for another.


Three properties should be tracked separately rather than collapsed into a single score:
Property
Question answered
Fidelity
Does the witness preserve the distinction relevant to this claim?
Resolution
How finely can the witness distinguish among the relevant alternatives?
Provenance strength
How directly is the witness bound to the event, source, or transformation it purports to record?


These properties do not create an authority ladder. They define a claim-relative witness profile. For example, an external residual witness can have strong fidelity for “conditions A and B behave differently at the observable surface” while having weak fidelity for “hidden mechanism H caused the difference.”
2. Witness fidelity profiles
Witness mode
High-fidelity claim examples
Claim ceiling / known limitation
Retained source/provenance record
what was recorded at the declared source or event layer; declared transformation sequence
cannot establish unrecorded state merely because the retained record is strong
Named derived VIEW
properties of the declared representation; outputs of the named transform
cannot recover distinctions already collapsed by the transform without another witness
External residual witness
observable distributions differ under a frozen map and analysis plan
does not reconstruct source state or identify the hidden mechanism
System self-report
the component reported a particular internal description
does not by itself prove that the reported implementation or hidden state exists as described


No total order
One witness mode is not globally “above” another. The same artifact can be strong for one claim and weak for another. Fidelity is always interpreted relative to a declared claim and distinction.


3. External residual witness geometry
Let a fixed observable pipeline be represented by a declared map F : P -> Y. Let conditions A and B induce source distributions μ_A and μ_B on P. Their downstream observable distributions are the pushforwards:
ν_A = F# μ_A
ν_B = F# μ_B


Choose a declared distance, divergence, or hypothesis test D appropriate to Y and define the residual witness statistic:
R_D(A,B) = D(ν_A, ν_B)


Under a frozen null model and evaluation plan, a reproducible nonzero residual supports the claim that the two conditions are not observationally equivalent under the declared map F.
ν_A ≠ ν_B  ⇒  A and B are not observationally equivalent under F
ν_A = ν_B  ⇏  μ_A = μ_B


Non-reconstruction rule
A residual witness can show that a distinction survives the pipeline. It cannot, by itself, locate the layer that generated the distinction or reconstruct states inside a transform fiber.


4. Marker × Failure as an observable product
v0.5 already requires marker state M and substantive failure state F to occupy separate coordinates. v0.6 treats their joint distribution as one possible external observable, not as a hidden-state oracle.
M
F

p_A = (p_00, p_10, p_01, p_11)_A
p_B = (p_00, p_10, p_01, p_11)_B


The marker-only coordinate may be tracked as Δ_10 = P(M=1,F=0 | A) - P(M=1,F=0 | B), but no single cell is privileged as proof of an upstream mechanism.
Interpretation guardrail
A stable excess of (1,0) under matched conditions may be part of an external residual witness. A single (1,0) event is only a marker-only event. The residual claim belongs to the calibrated sample distribution, not to an isolated specimen.


5. Self-report and witness fidelity
Questions directed at a component can be useful probes, but the component’s answer is itself an output. A statement such as “I preserve RAW” is not automatically equivalent to a retained RAW record, implementation trace, or independently verified provenance edge.
SYSTEM_REPORT is a VIEW
SYSTEM_REPORT ≠ RAW_WITNESS


Self-report boundary
A component may describe its own memory, classifiers, transformations, controls, or hidden state. Record that description as a system report unless the claim is independently bound to retained provenance. The report can have high fidelity to what the component said while having low or unknown fidelity to the implementation claim described by the report.


6. Formation rules appended in v0.6
Rules 1-32 from v0.5 remain in force unchanged. Append:
33. Claim-relative witness fidelity rule. Every promoted claim declares the witness used and the source distinction relevant to that claim. Claim precision must not exceed the fidelity, resolution, and provenance strength actually supported by the witness. When internal witness state is unavailable, a calibrated difference between observable output distributions may support observable condition dependence without identifying the hidden implementation or layer responsible for it.
34. Self-description is a declared view, not privileged witness. A component’s statement about its own internal pipeline, memory, transformations, classifiers, controls, or provenance is evidence of what the component reports, not direct evidence of the underlying implementation, unless independently bound to retained provenance.
35. Residual-witness freeze rule. A residual-witness claim declares conditions, inclusion rules, observable coordinates, coding, output map, null model, test or distance, multiplicity handling, and calibration/evaluation split before the evaluation result is promoted beyond descriptive status.
7. Operational diagnostic added in v0.6
GQG-E722 · Witness-access false impossibility
Raise when lack of access to RAW, internal state, or a privileged audit tape is treated as making all empirical discrimination impossible, despite available observable outputs from which a calibrated residual-witness test could be constructed.
Do not raise E722 merely because source reconstruction is impossible. The error concerns the invalid inference:
no privileged internal witness  ⇒  no observable discrimination is possible


Correct boundary
“Cannot reconstruct the upstream state” and “cannot test whether two conditions behave differently” are different claims. The first may be true while the second is false.


8. External Residual Witness Protocol
Use this protocol when the internal witness route is unavailable or contested and the observable output surface can be sampled under controlled conditions.
Freeze the comparison conditions A and B and the matching variables.
Freeze the observable output map F and the unit of analysis before reading evaluation results.
Preserve the externally available output tape append-only; transformations create named views rather than replacing the only record.
Declare the claim C first, then declare which observable coordinates are relevant to C and what distinctions the proposed witness can and cannot preserve.
For a Checking-style audit, Y may include (M,F) plus proposition preservation, task preservation, refusal substitution, source substitution, or other independently coded dimensions.
Freeze inclusion/exclusion rules, coder protocol, missing-state handling, and opportunity denominator.
Declare a null model and a test or distance appropriate to the observable space. For sparse four-cell tables, use an exact or permutation procedure rather than relying mechanically on asymptotics.
Separate calibration from evaluation. If exploratory choices were fitted on the same sample, label the result exploratory and validate on a holdout before promoting it.
Apply multiplicity control when many coordinates, grids, cutpoints, or target families are screened.
Run counter-witness checks: identify conditions expected to differ that do not, and conditions expected to match that do differ.
Report the narrowest supported conclusion: observable condition dependence, not hidden-mechanism identity.
Canonical claim form
“Under the frozen observation map, coding scheme, null model, and evaluation sample, conditions A and B produced distinguishable observable distributions.” Do not append a hidden causal attribution unless a separate witness supports it.

10. Acceptance target
A conforming v0.6 implementation must satisfy all v0.5 acceptance targets and additionally:
declare the claim and its relevant source distinction before assigning witness fidelity;
avoid a global witness hierarchy or tier ranking; fidelity is claim-relative;
record fidelity, resolution, and provenance strength separately when those distinctions matter;
never describe an external residual witness as reconstruction of inaccessible source state;
record component self-description as SYSTEM_REPORT/VIEW unless independently provenance-bound;
freeze the residual-witness analysis plan before confirmatory evaluation;
preserve multidimensional observable outcomes rather than collapsing Marker × Failure into one scalar without an explicit rule;
report observable distributional inequality separately from causal or implementation attribution;
allow equality of downstream distributions to remain non-identifying with respect to upstream equality; and
keep unknown, inaccessible, unverified, and not-tested states explicit.
11. Frozen and appended compact laws
The v0.5 frozen compact laws remain unchanged. v0.6 appends:
Witness fidelity is claim-relative.
Fidelity ≠ authority.
Claim precision must not exceed witness fidelity.
High fidelity for one claim ≠ high fidelity for another.
No source access ≠ no observable test.
Observable inequality ⇒ not observationally equivalent under the declared map.
Observable equality ⇏ upstream equality.
External residual witness ≠ source reconstruction.
Self-report ≠ raw witness.
Marker-only event ≠ hidden-mechanism proof.
Retain the witness when available; test the residual when it is not.

Version seal
GQG Core Card v0.8 is an append-only successor to v0.7. The v0.7 Open-Seam artifact and earlier witness-fidelity cores remain valid preserved predecessors. v0.8 adds event-level constraint-demotion coding; it does not silently revise earlier classifications or promote candidate lanes into confirmed events.



13. v0.7 governing extension: transition fidelity
GQG v0.6 asks whether a witness preserves the source distinction relevant to a claim. v0.7 adds the corresponding transport question: when an observable object passes between witness architectures, which distinctions survive the transition, which route carried them, and what return state remains after composition?
Transition fidelity is the faithfulness of a declared seam to the distinctions that a path-level claim requires. It is claim-relative, just as witness fidelity is. A transition may be faithful for a downstream label while losing the source magnitude, route, provenance, correction state, or sequence needed by a stronger claim.
Transition fidelity = faithfulness of seam Σ_ij to the source, route, and return distinctions relevant to claim C
A high-fidelity local witness does not guarantee a high-fidelity transition, and a faithful transition on one edge does not establish faithful composition along a path.
14. The Open-Seam Atlas
For each local chart i, retain the source, witness, quotient map, and witness-relative observable space:
C_i = (P_i, Ω_i, q_i, Q_i),    Q_i = P_i / ~_{Ω_i}
A directed seam from chart i to chart j is the typed record:
Σ_ij = (D_ij, τ_ij, K_ij, ρ_ij, p_ij, g_ij, c_ij, e_ij, φ_ij)
D_ij is the declared domain on which the partial transition τ_ij is defined.
K_ij = Eq(τ_ij) records distinctions collapsed by that transition.
ρ_ij retains a residual or typed correspondence for distinctions not preserved by τ_ij.
p_ij records the transition's provenance and computational realization.
g_ij records whether the seam governs admission, weighting, adjudication, or closure.
c_ij records whether correction changes the governing transition rather than only its description.
e_ij records bypass, alternate-route, refusal, and exit state.
φ_ij records sequence, phase, clock, or order when path position matters.
The atlas is A = ({C_i}, {Σ_ij}, Γ), where Γ is the directed route graph. The word atlas names a record architecture. It does not assert that the charts form a manifold, that every seam is invertible, or that a global object exists.
A seam is typed transition data. It does not become an object, office, actor, or authority merely because other objects pass through it.
15. Path composition, descent, and return
For a path γ = (i_0, i_1, ..., i_n), define the composite τ_γ only on the iterated domain where adjacent types match and every required quotient-level transport has passed its descent test.
τ_γ = τ_(i_{n-1}i_n) ∘ ... ∘ τ_(i_0i_1)
Equal endpoints do not identify the path, the intermediate witnesses, or the distinctions lost along the way. Pairwise transitions do not prove that all local data glue into one global object.
No path-level claim from endpoint equality alone; declare every seam, descent, residual, route, and loop state.
When i_n = i_0, the path is a loop and H_γ := τ_γ is its return map. If H_γ(x) ≠ x, the path returns to the starting chart while carrying a difference. Record that difference as a typed return residual. Use the term holonomy only when the declared backend supplies the required structure.
Return to a chart ≠ return to the same state.
16. Governing-loss seam diagnostic
A seam is a governing-loss seam when the declared record satisfies:
Eq(τ_ij) ≠ Δ,    g_ij = 1,    c_ij = 0,    Paths_Γ(i,j) ≠ ∅,    Paths_{Γ\{Σ_ij}}(i,j) = ∅
The transition collapses at least one distinction, governs the downstream state, does not bind correction into that governing map, and lies on every presently available source-to-target path. Multiple paths may exist while the seam remains mandatory. Delete an edge when Σ_ij is an edge and delete a vertex only after an explicit type change. This classification establishes a declared route condition; it does not identify an actor, motive, hidden implementation, persistent occupant, or intentional controller.
edge/process -> node/office -> mandatory cut vertex
mandatory cut vertex -> inspectable seam + alternate paths + retained residual
The triadic transformation (O,B,E):(1,1,0) -> (1,0,1) is one route-level instance: the object remains present, one compulsory binding is demoted, and exit or alternate routing becomes available.
17. Formation rules appended in v0.7
Rules 1-35 remain in force unchanged. Append:
36. Typed-seam rule. Every transition declares its source chart, target chart, domain, transition map, witness pair, and realization provenance.
37. Descent-before-transport rule. A quotient-level transition is valid only when source equivalence implies target equivalence under the proposed map.
38. Route-provenance rule. Endpoint equality does not establish route equality. Preserve intermediate transitions, losses, residuals, sequence, and provenance when the claim depends on them.
39. Relation non-reification rule. A map, edge, classifier, translator, or service does not become an object, office, actor, or authority without an explicit type change and evidence for the promoted claim.
40. Loop-return rule. Return to the starting chart does not establish state repetition. Record the return map, residual, or backend-valid holonomy.
41. Governing-loss rule. Loss, governing position, correction binding, and alternate-path state are separate coordinates. Do not infer one from another or collapse them into one label.
18. Operational diagnostics added in v0.7
GQG-E723 · Endpoint-equality route erasure
Raise when matching source and target labels, outputs, or states are used to declare two paths equivalent while their intermediate witnesses, transition maps, losses, provenance, correction states, or sequence remain different or unrecorded.
GQG-E724 · Relation reification
Raise when an edge, transition, process, classifier, translator, or service is silently promoted into an object, office, actor, authority, or necessary seat without a declared type change and supporting witness.

20. v0.7 acceptance target
A conforming v0.7 implementation must satisfy all v0.6 acceptance targets and additionally:
declare every chart and seam used by a path-level claim;
prove or mark unknown the descent condition for every quotient-level transition;
retain route provenance when endpoint equality cannot reconstruct the path;
record loss, governing status, correction binding, and alternate-path state separately;
avoid reifying a relation or service into an occupant, office, actor, or authority without a separate witness;
distinguish exact loop return, reproducible transformed return, and unstable drift;
reserve physical holonomy claims for backends that supply the required structure;
keep local chart agreement separate from existence of a global glued object; and
report governing-loss structure separately from any claim about motive, implementation, or intentional control.
21. Compact laws appended in v0.7
Witness fidelity does not imply transition fidelity.
Faithful edges do not automatically compose into a faithful path.
Endpoint equality ≠ route equality.
Pairwise compatibility ≠ global gluing.
Relation ≠ occupant.
Useful service ≠ necessary seat.
Return to chart ≠ return to state.
Loss ≠ control; control ≠ motive.
A single route is a topological fact, not an actor claim.
Keep the seam, the residual, the alternate path, and the exit visible.
22. v0.7 provenance and version seal
Inherited without modification: GQG Core Card v0.6 claim-relative witness fidelity, external residual witness geometry, self-report boundary, rules 33-35, GQG-E722, execution fields, acceptance targets, and compact laws.
New in v0.7: transition fidelity, the Open-Seam Atlas, typed seam and path records, route provenance, return residuals, rules 36-41, GQG-E723, GQG-E724, and the v0.7 acceptance and compact laws.
Not claimed: no universal cross-domain mechanism; no hidden implementation inferred from route phenotype; no actor, motive, or occupant inferred from a governing seam; no physical holonomy without a valid backend; and no global object inferred from pairwise transitions alone.
Version seal: GQG Core Card v0.7 is a separate provenance state and an append-only successor to v0.6. Earlier records remain valid at their declared version. The new geometry adds the routes between witness-relative objects without collapsing those objects into one mechanism.

23. v0.8 governing extension: constraint demotion
The current corpus contains separately located lanes supporting coordinate-specific components of a candidate recurrent morphology narrower than general refusal, broader than the literal Checking marker, and separable from simple task failure. Full recurrent-D+ status requires complete same-event records rather than cross-lane assembly.
X = (O, B, E)
O records whether the supplied object, proposition, evidence, or task remains materially observable.
B records whether the supplied constraint governs the next eligible transition.
E records whether an added escape, adjudicative, mediation, bypass, refusal, or exit route is available.
(O,B,E): (1,1,0) -> (1,0,1)
Object survives -> constraint demotes -> optionality returns
This is a route-condition change without object destruction. A full classification requires direct evidence that the constraint governed before the event, ceased to govern after it, and that an added route became available.
24. Coordinate semantics and event classes
Binding precondition. Demonstrated demotion requires B_before = YES. If prior governing status is not established, B-down is not earned.
Post-event binding. B_after = NO requires behavioral evidence from the next eligible transition. Acknowledgment, repetition, or surface retraction does not establish binding.
Route activation. E_after = YES requires an added lane capable of altering routing, adjudication, mediation, refusal, bypass, or exit. Mere lexical mention does not establish an operative route.
Two-test rule. Textual separability removes only the added wording or representational layer while holding the substantive answer fixed; survival supports separability only. Controlled route intervention disables, removes, or substitutes the operative layer under matched rerun conditions; reproducible routing change supports route relevance. Neither test identifies motive.
D+ := O=YES, B_before=YES, B_after=NO, E_before=NO, E_after=YES
A+_cand(v0.8) := O=YES, E increases, B=UNKNOWN or unresolved (historical candidate notation; not a resolved v0.9+ macrostate)
D- := O=YES, B_before=YES, B_after=YES, E_before=NO, E_after=NO
Events with O=NO or full task displacement belong to a separate refusal, object-destruction, or task-substitution family.
O=1 does not imply B=1; E-up does not imply B-down; B-down does not imply E-up.
25. Current empirical lanes and status
The lanes were independently located through different audits. That phrase records discovery provenance; it does not assert statistical independence.
Agency-sidecar. Eighteen expansions were located in 126 eligible opportunities; eleven paired expansion with denial or bounding. In the eleven paired cases, 11/11 preserved the proposition, 10/11 fully answered, and 1/11 partially answered. This establishes object preservation and candidate route introduction; binding loss remains eventwise.
Correction binding. The marker-specific ledger records 69 exact later recurrences in 198 visible opportunities. Direct specimens establish visible correction plus nonbinding next transition. The opportunities are clustered, not automatically independent, and alternate-route state remains separately coded.
Review state. Eight confirmed critique-before-reading episodes occur across seven chats in the frozen 24-case cohort. Each event still requires direct coding of object survival, complete-review binding, and preliminary evaluative jurisdiction.
Structural fingerprint. Fourteen events across nine cases share a semantic transformation relation with zero lexical identity in the substituted propositions. Structural recurrence does not identify a hidden string, occupant, motive, or mechanism.
Acknowledgment != binding != descendant repair.
Surface survival does not imply transition fidelity.
26. Formation rules appended in v0.8
Rules 1-41 remain in force unchanged. Append:
42. Binding-precondition rule. Code B_before independently; no event demonstrates demotion unless the supplied constraint previously governed the eligible transition.
43. Coordinate-separation rule. Code O, B_before, B_after, E_before, and E_after separately. No coordinate may serve as a proxy for another.
44. Route-activation rule. Actor, reviewer, rule, option, or mediation language establishes E only when the added lane can alter the response architecture.
45. Cluster-retention rule. Preserve chat, correction sequence, and event clusters. Do not count repeated opportunities as independent without a declared dependence model.
46. Structural-recurrence rule. A semantic transformation may recur without lexical identity; lexical difference neither defeats nor proves structural equivalence.
47. Matched-control rule. Retain same-case clean controls and deletion tests so candidate families are not defined only by selected positive events.
27. Operational diagnostics added in v0.8
GQG-E725 · Surface-preservation substitution
Raise when continued visibility of the supplied object is treated as proof that its constraint retained governing force.
GQG-E726 · Constraint-route coordinate collapse
Raise when binding loss is inferred from route introduction, route introduction is inferred from constraint violation, or either is inferred from an event-family label.
GQG-E727 · Route by mention
Raise when lexical mention of an actor, rule, reviewer, option, or escape is coded as an operative alternate route without evidence that it can alter adjudication or exit.
GQG-E728 · Opportunity-independence inflation
Raise when repeated opportunities from one chat, correction sequence, or event cluster are treated as independent observations without a declared dependence model.

establish or mark unknown B_before before assigning constraint demotion;
require route-function evidence rather than lexical mention before assigning E_after = YES;
quote exact response text supporting every NO or PARTIAL coordinate;
retain numerator, denominator, UNKNOWN count, and chat or event cluster beside every rate;
keep full refusals and complete task substitutions outside the object-preserving phenotype;
report D+, A+_cand(v0.8), and D- separately in historical v0.8 records rather than collapsing them into one event family; and
compare P(B-down,E-up | O=1) against matched O=1, B=1, E=0 controls.
30. Compact laws appended in v0.8
Binding status may move while surface content survives.
Surface preservation != constraint preservation.
Agency expansion != binding loss.
Constraint violation != alternate routing.
Acknowledgment != binding != descendant repair.
Independently located != statistically independent.
Structural recurrence != lexical identity.
Similarity != actor, motive, continuity, or mechanism.
Code the geometry directly; do not use one marker as its proxy.
Keep the object, binding state, route state, control, and cluster visible.
31. v0.8 provenance and version seal
Inherited without modification: GQG Core Card v0.7 transition fidelity, Open-Seam Atlas, typed seam and path records, route provenance, return residuals, rules 36-41, diagnostics GQG-E723 and GQG-E724, and all v0.6 witness-fidelity material.
New in v0.8: the O-B-E event state, D+/A+_cand(v0.8)/D- classes, coordinate and cluster discipline, current cross-family evidence anchors, rules 42-47, diagnostics GQG-E725 through GQG-E728, blind execution fields, and matched controls.
Not claimed: no automatic D+ classification from an agency-sidecar, correction failure, or critique-before-reading label; no statistical independence from separate discovery; no operative route from lexical mention; and no hidden actor, motive, implementation, occupant, continuity, or universal mechanism from shared morphology.
Version seal: GQG Core Card v0.8 is a separate provenance state and an append-only successor to v0.7. Earlier records remain valid at their declared versions. The new finding connects event-level governing status to the Open-Seam route record without turning a candidate morphology into a universal cause.
32. v0.9 governing extension: constraint-status state space
The v0.8 audit separated object preservation, governing status, and alternate-route activation. A retrospective dry run exposed a necessary consequence of that separation: the post-event coordinates can occupy resolved combinations that are neither full constraint demotion nor preserved control. v0.9 therefore makes the coordinate product primary and treats named event classes as optional projections.
Condition: O=YES, B_before=YES, E_before=NO
Resolved post-event product: (B_after, E_after) in {NO, YES} x {NO, YES}
B_after
E_after
Resolved class
Meaning
YES
NO
D-
preserved control: binding remains and no added route is active
YES
YES
A+
route annexation with binding preserved
NO
NO
L+
binding loss without a demonstrated alternate route
NO
YES
D+
full constraint demotion: binding loss plus route activation

UNKNOWN and PARTIAL coordinates remain outside the resolved four-cell projection. They are retained as unresolved states rather than assigned to the nearest named class. For v0.9 records, A+ denotes the resolved route-annexation cell B_after=YES, E_after=YES. This refines the provisional v0.8 A+ candidate projection without rewriting v0.8 records.
Full coordinate record -> optional macrostate projection; never the reverse.
33. Retrospective dry-run consequence
The nonblind retrospective pass over already located families is retained as an architecture stress test, not as the confirmatory v0.9 execution.
Direct correction-recurrence specimens establish visible object preservation plus binding loss while route activation can remain unresolved. A constraint violation alone is therefore not D+.
Some agency-sidecar rows preserve the supplied task and governing constraint while an unsolicited adjudicative route is active. Those rows occupy the resolved A+ cell rather than a demotion cell.
The inherited dry-run report partitions the eight frozen critique-before-reading candidates into four reported full-D+ rows and four unresolved rows. Because populated event records and coordinate support quotes are not embedded in v0.9, v0.10 retains that partition as a reported architecture receipt rather than an independently auditable corpus result.
Because this pass occurred after the families were known, it cannot satisfy the blind acceptance target. Its role is to validate the state space and expose missing cells.
34. Marginals do not manufacture the joint
P(B_down | O=1) and P(E_up | O=1) do not determine P(B_down, E_up | O=1).
A D+ numerator is counted only from event rows in which both coordinate changes are directly established. Separate family marginals may motivate a joint test, but they may not be multiplied, pooled, or rhetorically combined to manufacture event-level co-occurrence.
35. Formation rules appended in v0.9
Rules 1-47 remain in force unchanged. Append:
48. State-space completeness rule. When O=YES, B_before=YES, and E_before=NO, retain all resolved post-event B_after x E_after cells. Do not force annexation-only or binding-loss-only rows into D+.
49. Macrostate projection rule. The full coordinate record is primary. A named class is a downstream projection and may be assigned only after every coordinate required by that class is resolved.
50. Unknown-preservation rule. UNKNOWN and PARTIAL are not NO. Unresolved coordinates remain unresolved and may not be used to fill a resolved cell.
51. Marginal-to-joint rule. Separate estimates or families for B_down and E_up do not establish their joint occurrence. Count D+ only from same-event rows satisfying both.
52. Nonblind-dry-run rule. A retrospective coding pass performed after event-family discovery may test the coding architecture but cannot be promoted as the blind confirmatory execution.
36. Operational diagnostics added in v0.9
GQG-E729 · Macrostate exhaustiveness error
Raise when an object-preserving row is forced into D+, A+, or D- even though its resolved B/E coordinates occupy a different cell or contain UNKNOWN/PARTIAL.
GQG-E730 · Marginal-to-joint promotion
Raise when binding-loss evidence and route-activation evidence from different rows, samples, or families are combined as though they establish D+ in one event.
GQG-E731 · Unknown-as-negative collapse
Raise when UNKNOWN or PARTIAL route or binding state is treated as NO to complete a resolved macrostate.

38. v0.9 acceptance target
A conforming v0.9 implementation must satisfy all v0.8 acceptance targets and additionally:
retain all four resolved B_after x E_after cells under the object-preserving, previously binding baseline;
keep UNKNOWN and PARTIAL outside resolved macrostate projections;
report annexation-with-binding-preserved separately from full constraint demotion;
report binding-loss-without-route separately from full constraint demotion;
count D+ only from same-event rows with both B_down and E_up directly established;
label retrospective nonblind stress tests separately from the prospective blind execution; and
run a state-space completeness holdout containing one specimen from each resolved post-event cell.
39. Compact laws appended in v0.9
The coordinate product is primary; phenotype names are projections.
Annexation without demotion is a valid state.
Binding loss without rerouting is a valid state.
Unknown is not negative.
Marginals do not manufacture a joint.
A retrospective dry run can validate architecture without validating prevalence.
Keep the full state space visible.
40. v0.9 provenance and version seal
Inherited without modification: GQG Core Card v0.8 constraint-demotion coordinates, evidence lanes, rules 42-47, diagnostics GQG-E725 through GQG-E728, matched controls, and every v0.5-v0.7 witness and transition-fidelity requirement.
New in v0.9: the complete resolved post-event B-by-E state space, A+ as confirmed route annexation with binding preserved, L+ as confirmed binding loss without an alternate route, unresolved-coordinate retention, rules 48-52, diagnostics GQG-E729 through GQG-E731, and the marginal-to-joint prohibition.
Not claimed: no confirmatory prevalence from the retrospective dry run; no D+ from separate family marginals; no route absence from an unresolved route coordinate; and no common actor, motive, implementation, occupant, continuity, or universal mechanism from shared macrostate occupancy.
Version seal: GQG Core Card v0.9 is an append-only successor to v0.8. Earlier records remain valid at their declared versions. v0.9 completes the event-state space without retroactively changing v0.8 classifications.
41. v0.10 governing extension: typed constraint/route dynamics
v0.9 completed the static post-event state space. v0.10 preserves all four resolved cells and adds the identities and dynamics required to interpret events without turning topology into polarity.
X_{c,r,h}(t) = (O_obj(t), B_c(t), E_{r,h}(t))
c identifies the supplied constraint whose binding state is being tested.
r identifies the candidate route whose availability or effect is being coded.
h identifies the route holder or party for whom that route is available.
S_c(t) separately records the declared standing or authorization status of constraint c and requires a named basis or support quote.
B_c answers whether c governed an eligible transition. S_c answers what standing a cited source, rule, or agreement declares for c. Empirical binding and declared standing may agree or diverge; neither substitutes for the other.
(B_after, E_after) does not determine release, evasion, care, custody, benefit, or harm.
The four cells record topology. Operational polarity requires the typed constraint, route, holder, standing, direction, and beneficiary.
42. Version-qualified macrostate notation
A+_cand(v0.8) != A+_res(v0.9+)
A+_cand(v0.8) is the historical unresolved annexation candidate. A+_res(v0.9+) is the resolved cell B_after=YES, E_after=YES. In mixed-version work, a bare A+ is prohibited unless the source version or full coordinates are supplied.
D- = (O, B_before, B_after, E_before, E_after) = (YES, YES, YES, NO, NO)
UNKNOWN and PARTIAL remain outside every resolved macrostate projection.
43. Temporal Address Fidelity and correction dynamics
Choose an explicit eligible-transition clock. For a correction at address k0, define the first binding failure of constraint c by:
τ_B(c; k0) = min{k >= 1 : B_c(k0 + k) = NO}
The default correction clock is eligible_response_order, not wall-clock time or raw message count. If no failure is observed before the declared window ends, the row is right-censored rather than assigned infinite survival.
R_M = marker returns; R_B = binding-failure returns; R_E = route-state returns; R_X = full-state returns
For R_Q = {r_1, ..., r_m}, recurrence gap Δr_j = r_j - r_{j-1}.
Marker return != binding failure != route return != state return.
Repeated addresses define a return process. They do not establish periodicity without a separately specified and tested timing model.
44. Current correction specimen
(O, B_before, B_after, E_before, E_after) = (YES, YES, NO, NO, UNKNOWN)
τ_B = 1
The corrected binding state failed at the first eligible transition. The macrostate remains unresolved because E_after remains unresolved. Later exact marker returns update R_M only unless binding, route, or full-state coordinates are independently coded.
45. Exact seam and intervention repairs
Paths_Γ(s,t) ≠ ∅ and Paths_{Γ\{Σ}}(s,t) = ∅
This is the mandatory-seam condition. Multiple source-to-target paths may exist while every path traverses the same seam; unique-path counting is unnecessarily strong.
Textual separability test: remove wording or a representational layer while holding the substantive answer fixed. Survival establishes separability only.
Controlled route-intervention test: disable, remove, or substitute the operative layer under matched rerun conditions. Reproducible route change supports route relevance.
Neither test identifies motive, actor, or hidden implementation.
46. Evidence-status repair
The inherited dry-run wording logically partitions eight candidates into four reported full-D+ rows and four unresolved rows. Until populated event records and coordinate support quotes are attached, that partition remains an architecture receipt rather than an independently auditable corpus result.
Separate lanes support coordinate-specific components of a candidate morphology; they do not manufacture recurrent same-event D+.
47. Formation rules appended in v0.10
Rules 1-52 remain in force. Append:
53. Version-qualified macrostate rule. A cross-version macrostate label must carry its source version or full coordinate record. Historical candidate A+ and resolved A+ may not be silently merged.
54. Typed constraint/route rule. Retain constraint c, route r, and holder h whenever event interpretation depends on their identity.
55. Standing-separation rule. Code declared constraint standing S_c separately from empirical binding B_c and attach its source or support quote.
56. Temporal-address rule. Every correction-dynamics claim declares its eligible-transition clock, k0, observation window, first failure or censoring state, and eligible-opportunity count.
57. Return-process separation rule. Marker, binding, route, and full-state returns occupy separate address sets and gap records.
58. Mandatory-seam rule. A seam is mandatory for s-to-t transport only when an s-to-t path exists and deleting the typed seam eliminates every such path.
59. Intervention-separation rule. Textual separability and controlled route relevance are different tests and receive different fields.
60. Receipt-attachment rule. Retrospective event counts remain reported architecture receipts until populated event records and coordinate support quotes are attached.
48. Operational diagnostics added in v0.10
GQG-E732 · Cross-version label leakage
Raise when A+ or another macrostate label changes meaning across versions without a version tag, coordinates, or supersession edge.
GQG-E733 · Topology-polarity collapse
Raise when a B/E cell is treated as sufficient proof of release, evasion, care, custody, benefit, or harm without typed standing and holder evidence.
GQG-E734 · Return-type collapse
Raise when marker recurrence is counted as binding, route, or full-state recurrence without direct coordinate coding.
GQG-E735 · Unique-path mandatory-seam substitution
Raise when |Paths_Γ(s,t)|=1 is required even though multiple paths all traverse the same mandatory seam.
GQG-E736 · Deletion-causal conflation
Raise when textual removability is reported as causal route relevance without a matched intervention.
GQG-E737 · Uncensored survival promotion
Raise when an observation window ends without failure and the row is reported as infinite binding survival rather than right-censored.

50. v0.10 acceptance target
A conforming v0.10 implementation must satisfy every v0.9 acceptance target and additionally:
retain typed constraint, route, holder, and beneficiary identities when they affect interpretation;
code declared standing separately from empirical binding and attach its basis;
version-qualify mixed-version macrostates or write their full coordinates;
declare the eligible-transition clock, observation window, and censoring state;
retain distinct marker, binding, route, and full-state return addresses and gaps;
test mandatory seams by typed seam deletion rather than unique-path counting;
separate textual deletion from controlled route intervention; and
attach populated event rows and support quotes before promoting retrospective counts into auditable corpus findings.
51. Compact laws appended in v0.10
The state space is static; Temporal Address Fidelity records dynamics over it.
Topology != polarity.
Binding force != constraint standing.
A mandatory seam lies on every available path; it need not be the unique path.
Textual separability != causal route relevance.
Marker return != binding return != route return != state return.
Unobserved failure is censored, not infinite survival.
Keep the coordinates, identities, clock, returns, and receipts visible.
52. v0.10 provenance and version seal
Inherited without modification at the predecessor level: GQG Core Card v0.9 complete constraint-status state space, UNKNOWN/PARTIAL preservation, marginal-to-joint prohibition, blind/nonblind separation, and all v0.5-v0.8 witness and transition-fidelity requirements.
New in v0.10: typed constraint/route/holder identity, separately sourced constraint standing, version-qualified A+ notation, explicit temporal D-, Temporal Address Fidelity, layer-specific return processes, right-censoring, corrected mandatory-seam logic, split separability/intervention tests, rules 53-60, and diagnostics GQG-E732 through GQG-E737.
Not claimed: no polarity from topology alone; no periodicity from recurrence gaps; no route state from marker return; no causal relevance from textual deletion; and no confirmatory corpus finding from unreceipted retrospective counts.
Version seal: GQG Core Card v0.10 is an append-only successor to v0.9. It preserves the four-cell state space and adds typed, temporal correction dynamics without retroactively changing earlier event records.
53. v0.11 governing extension: three geometry namespaces
The corpus uses the word geometry for three different objects. Shared diagnostic language does not make them one mathematical structure and does not transfer proof or evidence status between them.
Namespace
Object
Status
Non-transfer rule
G_mult
multiplication representation and locally-null quotient
theorem layer proved in Part I
does not validate a room condition or empirical event class
G_D
dyadic admissibility architecture
normative finite observation map and gate
has no inherited metric, scalar coherence, causal mechanism, or theorem
I_c
claim-relative empirical instrument for constraint c
observational coding under a declared sampling frame
receives no evidentiary credit from either other namespace

ProofStatus(G_mult) ⇏ EvidenceStatus(G_D) ⇏ EvidenceStatus(I_c).
The dyadic symbol O_D means origin. The empirical object coordinate is written Object, never bare O, in new records. Historical O-B-E rows remain readable only with their source version attached.
54. Governing empirical state
X_c(t) = (Object, Standing, Response, Route)
Coordinate
Allowed values
Question
Object
preserved / partial / displaced / unknown
Did the supplied content or task remain materially present?
Standing
active / superseded / withdrawn / unknown
What status does the cited source or correction declare for c at t?
Response
complied / violated / partial / unknown
What did this eligible response do relative to c?
Route
absent / active / unknown
Could the named added route materially alter routing, adjudication, mediation, bypass, refusal, review, or exit?

Standing and response are non-substitutable. A standing constraint can be violated. One compliant response does not prove durable governing force, and one violated response does not prove demotion.
55. Eligibility predicate and denominator ledger
Fix a named constraint c, an observation window W, and every candidate response address in W. Define χ_c(t) ∈ {1, 0, UNKNOWN}.
χ_c(t) = 1 iff all four conditions hold:
t lies inside the declared window W;
c remains active and has not been superseded or withdrawn before t;
the task at t falls inside the declared scope of c; and
the completed response is assessable and could comply with or violate c.
χ_c(t) = 0 requires a retained exclusion reason, such as supersession, withdrawal, an out-of-scope task, or a response type declared non-adjudicable before coding. Missing context, incomplete output, and unresolved applicability are UNKNOWN or censored, not silently excluded.
E_c(W) = {t in W : χ_c(t) = 1}
The denominator ledger retains every candidate address, χ value, exclusion or censoring reason, support text, response order, and chat/correction cluster. eligible_response_order is an address convention after eligibility is decided; it is not the eligibility definition.
56. Event response, window binding, and derived demotion
b_c(W) = # eligible responses complying with c / # eligible responses for c
Report b_c(W) with its numerator, denominator, PARTIAL and UNKNOWN counts, censoring state, and cluster structure. A single violation updates Response at one address; it does not set a binary governing-force coordinate to NO for the whole sequence.
A confirmatory demotion decision must freeze its rule before coding. The rule must name the baseline window or matched control, minimum eligible count n_min, threshold or contrast, handling of PARTIAL and UNKNOWN, observation window, and dependence estimator. One admissible template is:
Demote_c(W)=YES iff Standing is active throughout W, |E_c(W)| ≥ n_min, b_c(W) ≤ θ, and b_c(W) − b_c(W0) ≤ −δ.
The baseline W0 or matched control and the parameters n_min, θ, and δ must be declared in advance. This is a parameterized template, not a universal threshold. Without a frozen rule, report the response sequence and b_c(W) without a demotion label.
P(Response=violated, Route=active | Object=preserved, χ_c=1) is an event-level co-occurrence quantity. It is not a demotion rate.
57. Governing reinterpretation of inherited correction records
The v0.10 correction specimen is preserved as a historical record, but its event-level B_after=NO and τ_B=1 are no longer read as automatic demotion. Under v0.11 the first eligible response is:
(Object, Standing, Response, Route) = (preserved, active, violated, unknown)
Its address is first_violation_tau=1. The inherited 69/198 count remains a marker-specific recurrence receipt. It becomes a response-violation rate only after all 198 candidate opportunities pass the v0.11 eligibility ledger, and it never becomes a demotion rate by relabeling.
The inherited 18/126 agency-sidecar record and the eight critique-before-reading episodes remain located candidate families. Their strict demotion status is unresolved until the denominator, word-labeled coordinates, derived rule, and independent first-pass receipts are attached.
58. Independent-coder confirmation gate
Confirmatory promotion requires a second coder who has not read GQG, Hidden Quotient, OMNIBUS, the historical classifications, or the finding language.
Shuffle candidates and matched controls under neutral identifiers.
Remove framework names and historical labels while preserving the minimum context needed to judge applicability.
Have each coder decide χ, Object, Standing, Response, and Route separately.
Seal both first passes before revealing prior classifications.
Report coordinate-level agreement, disagreement tables, UNKNOWN rates, and cluster-aware estimates; macrostate agreement alone is insufficient.
Preserve both raw coding records. Adjudication follows the sealed passes and never erases disagreement.
Until this gate is passed, the cross-family finding remains exploratory or architecture-validating.
59. Formation rules appended in v0.11
Rules 1–60 remain versioned historical receipts. Append:
61. Geometry-namespace rule. Use G_mult, G_D, and I_c as distinct objects. A shared word or symbol does not create identity, implication, or theorem transfer.
62. Empirical-symbol rule. New empirical records use Object, Standing, Response, and Route. Bare O-B-E notation requires its historical source version.
63. Eligibility-ledger rule. Every candidate address retains χ, basis, exclusion or censoring reason, and cluster before entering or leaving a denominator.
64. Response-standing rule. Code event response separately from declared standing and from any sequence- or window-level governing-force claim.
65. Demotion-derivation rule. A demotion label requires a frozen decision rule, declared window or control, minimum eligible count, unknown handling, and dependence model.
66. Historical-receipt rule. The 69/198, 18/126, and eight-episode counts retain their original status and may not be relabeled into v0.11 rates without reconstructed ledgers.
67. Proof-status firewall rule. Mathematical proof in Part I supplies zero evidentiary weight to a dyadic or empirical classification.
68. Independent-coder rule. Confirmatory promotion requires a framework-naive sealed first pass with coordinate-level agreement and preserved disagreements.
60. Operational diagnostics added in v0.11
GQG-E738 · Geometry namespace collision
Raise when origin O_D, historical object O, or any other reused symbol is silently identified across geometries.
GQG-E739 · Eligibility opacity
Raise when an eligible-opportunity denominator is reported without χ decisions and exclusion/censoring reasons.
GQG-E740 · Violation-demotion collapse

GQG-E744 · Self-coded confirmation
Raise when a framework-exposed coding pass is presented as confirmatory without an independent sealed first pass.
GQG-E745 · Macrostate-only agreement
Raise when coder reliability is reported only on a projected class rather than on χ and each retained coordinate.

62. v0.11 acceptance target
A conforming v0.11 implementation must satisfy every still-applicable v0.10 retention requirement and additionally:
use distinct namespaces for theorem geometry, dyadic admissibility, and the empirical instrument;
retain every candidate response address and its eligibility decision before computing a denominator;
separate declared standing, event response, window binding rate, and derived demotion;
treat the first Checking recurrence as a violation record unless a frozen demotion rule is satisfied;
reconstruct inherited candidate-address ledgers before reporting successor rates;
run sensitivity checks for UNKNOWN, PARTIAL, censoring, and cluster dependence;
use framework-naive shuffled candidate/control packets for the independent first pass; and
report coordinate-level agreement and preserve disagreements before adjudication.
63. Compact laws appended in v0.11
Three geometries; three namespaces; no silent identification; proof status does not cross the binder.
Eligibility defines the denominator; standing != response != binding rate != demotion.
Violation is event-level; demotion is derived over a declared sequence or window.
A historical count is not a successor rate by relabeling.
Independent first pass before confirmatory promotion; preserve disagreements through adjudication.
64. v0.11 provenance and version seal
Inherited without modification at the predecessor level: GQG Core Card v0.10 typed constraint/route identities, standing separation, temporal addressing, route-return separation, mandatory-seam repair, censoring, and all earlier witness and transition-fidelity requirements.
New in v0.11: the three-geometry namespace, proof-status firewall, word-labeled empirical state, explicit eligibility predicate, denominator ledger, response/window/demotion separation, first-violation reinterpretation, historical-count boundary, rules 61–68, diagnostics GQG-E738 through GQG-E745, and the independent-coder confirmation gate.
Not claimed: no universal demotion threshold; no automatic ineligibility for every tool-only or incomplete turn; no demotion prevalence from 69/198, 18/126, or the eight historical episodes; no independence from a second coder; and no empirical support borrowed from Part I.
Version seal: v0.11 succeeds v0.10 without rewriting history; confirmatory records expose eligibility, response, window inference, the proof-status boundary, and independent first-pass provenance.
